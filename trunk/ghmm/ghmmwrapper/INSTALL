GHMM_TOP is set in the Makefile to point to the parent ghmm directory,
so that you will see ghmm/lib automatically.

That means:
1. Install ghmm ( C version ) to set include and lib directories, by running
       % make install

2. Edit variables TOP, SWIG, PYTHON_LIB, PYTHON_INCLUDE to point to local installation
of SWIG and Python.

3. cd to ghmmwrapper and:
       % make

That should generate the dynamic library for use with Python.
