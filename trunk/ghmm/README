build from cvs:
===============

0. you need automake, autoconf and m4 from ftp://ftp.gnu.org

1. call autogen.sh
   (ignore messages like:
    automake: configure.in: installing `./mkinstalldirs'
        error while copying
   )

2. continue with normal build instructions as written in INSTALL

3. tests require DejaGNU (and this requires expect, a tcl based language)

experimental features:
======================

if some things are experimental and not portable, you can use 

#if __EXPERIMNETAL__ == 1

achim_s_suspicious_code;

#endif

to avoid confusion.
Activate this code by including the option --enable-experimental=1 in ./configure !

So allocate your number by appending it to the following list:

0: switched on for 0 and all strings that are not a number
   it will be compiled with --enable-experimental
1: achim (xml)
2: achim (cleanup and compartibility)
3: bernd wichern (sviterbi implementation)

If this code is working, but not tested by everybody, use

#ifdef __EXPERIMENTAL__

code_to_be_tested;

#endif

and everybody can use your feature by setting --enable-experimental .
