build from cvs:
===============

0. you need automake, autoconf and m4 from ftp://ftp.gnu.org

1. call autogen.sh
   (ignore messages like:
    automake: configure.in: installing `./mkinstalldirs'
        error while copying
   )

2. continue with normal build instructions as written in INSTALL

3. tests require DejaGNU (and this requires expect, a tcl based language)
