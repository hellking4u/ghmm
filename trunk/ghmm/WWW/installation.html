<h2>Installing GHMM</h2>

<h4>Prerequisites</H4>
<p>
<ul>

<li> Recent GCC, recent, working autoconf and automake. If you are running
a recent Linux distribution you should be fine. On the MacOS we recommend
using <a href="http://www.finkproject.org">Fink</A> to install all required
packages including Python.

<li> <A HREF="http://xmlsoft.org/">Libxml2</A>

<li> Optional: The GHMM is self-contained, but can make use of the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GSL</A>. Note that the GSL is
GPL licensed and that will AFAIK force your code under the GPL.  You
need to pass <kbd>--enable-gsl</kbd> option to configure to use the
GSL, in particular the nice collection of random number genetration.
			  
<li> For the optional Python wrappers you need the following. If
building without Python wrapper use the <kbd>--without-python</kbd>
option for configure.
				<ul>

<li> Python version 2.6.x or 2.7.x. GHMM is not yet compatible with
Python 3.x releases nor with earlier releases. Note that on many Linux
distributions the default installs are missing header files. You need
to add the developer Python packages (which might be called
python27-dev for example) and shared libs.
					
<li> <A HREF="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</A>, the simplified wrapper
interface generator version 2.0.1. More recent versions (in particular
2.0.8) cause errors. For the time being please just use 2.0.1.

<li> Optional: If you want to use the editor HMMEd you need X11 (or
equivalent), Tk and Tkinter and also the Gato package which you can
obtain from <A HREF="http://gato.sf.net">Sourceforge</A> or the <A
HREF="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Gato/">Python Package Index</A>.

<li> Optional: If you use the GSL also install the <A
HREF="http://pygsl.sf.net">Pygsl</A> Python bindings for the GSL.
</ul>
</ul>

</p>



<h4>Download</H4>
<p>Currently there are no releases. Please use the version out of the
SVN. There are detailed instructions at <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=67094">http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=67094</a>.
An anonymous checkout can simply be done by
<center>
<kbd>
svn co https://ghmm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ghmm/trunk/ghmm
</kbd>
</center>
</p>


<h4>Installation</H4>

<p>In the ideal case, installation is the same as for all GNU software from source:
In the ghmm directory issue the following commands.
<pre><kbd>
> autogen.sh
> ./configure
> make 
> make install
</kbd></pre>

This will install the GHMM into whatever path prefix is default for
autoconf on your system. Note that the <em>same</em> prefix is used
for installing the Python library, the path for the Python install is
<em>not</em> determined by the install location of the first python
found on your <kbd>PATH</kbd>. That is, if for example
<kbd>/usr/local</kbd> is the default for autoconf, the
<kbd>ghmm.py</kbd> will end up in
<kbd>/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages</kbd>. This will cause an
import error if your python is not installed in <kbd>/usr/local</kbd>
or <kbd>/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages</kbd> is not added to
your <kbd>PYTHONPATH</kbd> environment variable.<p/>

<p>If your Python is in a non-standard location for autoconf, you
probably want to install into the appropriate
<kbd>site-packages</kbd>. That is, if the Python interpreter invoked
by typing python in your shell is <kbd>/var/bin/python</kbd> than most
likely its library will be <kbd>/var/lib/pythonX.Y</kbd> and all
site-specific installs should end up in
<kbd>/var/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/</kbd> by default.</p>

<p>
There is a simple work-around as follows.
<pre><kbd>
> autogen.sh
> ./configure --without-python
> make 
> make install
> cd ghmmwrapper
> python setup.py build
> python setup.py install
</kbd></pre>
</P>
<p>Sometimes a more fine-grained control is needed. Then you can
specify the prefixes used for installation and the python interpreter
to use explicitely. 
<pre><kbd>
> autogen.sh
> ./configure --without-python --prefix=/some/path
> make 
> make install
> cd ghmmwrapper
> /some/otherpath/python setup.py build
> /some/otherpath/python setup.py install --prefix=/yetanotherpath/
</kbd></pre>
This might require setting your <kbd>PYTHONPATH</kbd> or
<kbd>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> environment variable appropriately.
</P>

<h4>OS-specific tips</H4> <p> 
<ul> 

<li>Mac OS X: 10.6 ships with a broken libtool which breaks the
installation (and it also ships with Python 2.5, so you need an update
for that). James Howard posted a solution on the mailing list: <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=AANLkTinGL0D4Oq7x%2Bvw6V7ZPXc6RkH3VNQ2zZz%3DMtpa9%40mail.gmail.com&forum_name=ghmm-list">[Ghmm-list]
Compiling in OS X 10.6</A>

<li>Windows: There is no Windows support. Installing Cygwin should
work. Check the mailing list; it seems that some people had success.

<li>Linux: various distributions are creative about install locations
and the scope of what actually is installed. You want the
developer/header whatever-they-are-called packages in addition to
that. Note that specific distributions also omit part of the Python
standard library (e.g., Ubuntu omits the Python profiler for licensing
reasons).

<li>C++: We used to have C++ bindings emulating the semantics of the
Python interface, but we lost interest after it became clear that
Python plus C is nicer and as fast.

</ul>

</p>



<h4>Troubleshooting</H4>


<p> <ul> 

</li>If <kbd>autogen.sh</kbd> and <kbd>configure</kbd> run without
problems but during make you get the error <kbd>libtool: Version
mismatch error.</kbd> please run <kbd>cautoreconf --force --install</kbd>
followed by <kbd>configure; make; make install ...</kbd>.


<li>There are more options to configure, check <kbd>configure
--help</kbd>. Note that <kbd>--disable-obsolete</kbd> is currently broken.

<li>There is anecdotal evidence that adding search paths to
<kbd>ghmm/ghmmwrapper/setup.py</kbd> is the easiest way to get around
install problems in really creative installations.

<li>If you don't have root access, installing somewhere in your home
directory by specifying the <kbd>--prefix</kbd> arguments seems to be
the path of least resistence. Then you need to set
<kbd>PYTHONPATH</kbd>, <kbd>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</kbd> and possibly
<kbd>PATH</kbd> accordingly in your <kbd>.bashrc</kbd>.

</ul>
